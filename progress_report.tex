\section{Can we teach languages to a robot like us ?}

Traditional way of learning in robots are known as machine learning.The process which gathers information around itself with sensors and feedbacks and robot trains it self with given sample data sets then interprets it from these data sets and makes estimations.

In Figure 1.1 it shows a different way of learning like our brain structure using neural networks.

\chapter{RESEARCH AIM AND OBJECTIVES}
\section{What are we going to do ?}

\begin{itemize}
	\item To understand how cognitive model for robots work
	\item To demonstrate and measure cognitive methods
	\item To extend known words,sentences to many and be able to implement correctly
\end{itemize}


\subsection{What We Will Use}

We won't be able to use iCub robot to demonstrate and apply our work.We will use iCub simulation on YARP (Yet Another Robot Platform) to measure and implement our methods.
